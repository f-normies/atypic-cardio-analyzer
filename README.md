# General Functionality

The Atypic Cardio Analyzer is a Python library designed to analyze atypical cardiomyocyte action potential. It provides various functionalities such as:

- Reading `.txt` files containing time and voltage data.
- Preprocessing the data with Gaussian filtering.
- Identifying action potentials in the data.
- Calculating the maximum slope and voltage speed.
- Saving action potentials to `.txt` and `.xlsx` files.
